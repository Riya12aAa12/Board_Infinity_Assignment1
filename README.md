# Task Management Board

This project is a Task Management Board built with React, designed to help you manage tasks with ease. It allows you to create, update, and track tasks across different statuses (TODO, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED) with a user-friendly interface. The tasks are saved in local storage, ensuring that your data persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Easily add new tasks with title, description, priority, and date.
- **Status Management**: Move tasks between TODO, IN PROGRESS, and COMPLETED columns.
- **Local Storage**: Saves tasks to local storage to persist data across page refreshes.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the task items.
